# Lights Out

This was a project I created that has similar functionality to the hand-held Tiger Electronics game "Lights Out", that saw some success in the mid 90s. I did this project to get more comfortable with CSS and Jquery selectors. The game board is 25 blank, classes divs which are manipulated to play the game.

The goal of the game is to get rid of all the dark squares. Every square you click swaps its color to the opposite, including the squares above, below, to the left, and right. The first 5 levels are custom made with any past that being randomly generated.
